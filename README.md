## AgriMind AI ðŸŒ±ðŸŒ¾
An AI-powered multilingual crop recommendation and farming FAQ assistant for Indian farmers

## Project Overview
AgriMind AI is an intelligent agricultural assistant designed to help farmers select the best crop to cultivate based on soil and weather parameters. It also serves as a multilingual FAQ chatbot that answers common farming-related questions using relevant agricultural documents. The system supports multiple Indian languages and provides recommendations with confidence scores alongside context-based answers sourced from official guides and policies.

## Features

# 1. Crop Recommendation
Uses a trained Random Forest machine learning model to predict the most suitable crop based on input features:

Nitrogen (N) level

Phosphorus (P) level

Potassium (K) level

Temperature (Â°C)

Humidity (%)

Soil pH

Rainfall (mm)

# 2. Multilingual FAQ Chatbot
Answers farmers' questions in their native language by:

Translating the query to English

Retrieving relevant agricultural document chunks using semantic search (FAISS + Sentence Transformers)

Generating a context-based answer with a state-of-the-art text generation model (FLAN-T5)

Translating the answer back to the farmerâ€™s language

# 3. Supports multiple Indian languages:
English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Odia

# 4. Interactive web UI powered by Gradio for easy access.

## Dataset Used
# 1. Crop Recommendation Dataset: 
Crop_recommendation.csv (soil and weather data with crop labels)

# 2. Farming FAQ Dataset: 
Farming_FAQ_Assistant_Dataset.csv (questions and answers dataset to build the FAQ knowledge base)

# 3. Agricultural Documents: 
Sample guides and policies saved as .txt files in /content/docs folder.

## How It Works

# 1. Data Preprocessing & Model Training

Loads crop dataset, processes features, and trains multiple classification models.

Random Forest model selected based on performance and saved using pickle.

MinMaxScaler used for feature normalization.

# 2. FAQ Knowledge Base Construction

Agricultural documents are chunked into smaller pieces.

Sentence embeddings computed using SentenceTransformer.

FAISS index built for fast semantic search.

# 3. Multilingual Translation & Text Generation

User queries translated to English using a multilingual translation pipeline.

Semantic search performed to find relevant context chunks.

Context and question fed to a FLAN-T5 model for answer generation.

Answer translated back to userâ€™s language.

# 4. User Interface

Gradio app with inputs for farmerâ€™s question, language, and soil/weather parameters.

Displays crop recommendation, AI-generated answer, and source documents.

## Installation
pip install -q transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu gradio pandas scikit-learn sentencepiece matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

## Usage
# 1. Prepare datasets:
Place Crop_recommendation.csv and Farming_FAQ_Assistant_Dataset.csv in your working directory.

# 2. Train and save the crop recommendation model:
Run the script to train the Random Forest model and save model.pkl and minmaxscaler.pkl.

# 3. Prepare agricultural documents:
Add .txt files containing agricultural policies and crop guides into /content/docs.

# 4. Run the Gradio app:
Launch the interactive interface to ask questions and get crop recommendations.

## Functions
 1. recommend_crop(N,P,K,temp,hum,ph,rain): Returns crop recommendation and confidence score.

 2. answer_query_multilingual(user_text, user_lang_code): Returns AI-generated answer and source docs in user language.

 3. full_chat(user_q, language, N,P,K,temp,hum,ph,rain): Combines crop recommendation and multilingual Q&A for the interface.
